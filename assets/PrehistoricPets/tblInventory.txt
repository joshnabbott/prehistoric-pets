This has made more options for the buyer than have ever been presented before. Not everything new is always exciting, but we are genuinely excited about this project. The burmese python has been a mainstay as one of the most popular pet reptiles for years because of its tractable disposition, modestly impressive size, and due to how prolific they have proven to be in captivity. The T+ Albino Burmese Python is a magnificent animal with gold and purple replacing the earth tones of a normally colored animal, and if you haven't seen one feel free to email for pictures.
