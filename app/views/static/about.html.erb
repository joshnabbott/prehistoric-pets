<h2>About us</h2>
<p>The history of Prehistoric Pets begins in 1988 when an ex-fisherman named Jay Brewer and his wife Becky opened a pet store in Fountain Valley, CA. The store was called Pet Country, and while stocking a variety of pets and pet supplies, the store was one of the first in the area to stock a large supply of reptiles. Pet Country began circulating a nationwide price list and soon adopted the slogan "The Reptile Leaders". In March of 1991, the business had grown to a point where expansion was appropriate (if not necessary). The decision was made to open a second store. This time, though, the store would deal exclusively with reptiles, amphibians, and all their needs. Prehistoric Pets was born. The first "Prehistoric Pets" was opened in Chino, CA. Many of the animal displays rival those of the best zoos! Plans were now underway to convert Pet Country into a Prehistoric Pets as well. The name on the price lists was changed, and Pet Country began using the new name. In 1992, Pet Country closed to make way for a new, 5000 square foot superstore which had been completed in Fountain Valley with the name "Prehistoric Pets". Jay and Becky wanted the new store to be more than just another "pet" store, so they went all out creating a "Zoo-like" experience for everyone who visits. From a 2000 gallon pond in the middle of the store, filled with Giant tropical fish to the 400lb. Galapagos Tortoise to the displays exhibiting over a thousand animals!</p>
<p>The Prehistoric Pets enterprise has always been on the cutting edge when it comes to the herp market. While originally having a large import business, Prehistoric Pets now focuses mostly on hand selected captive bred animals. We have been at the Florida Expo for 7 consecutive years. We have been among the first to bring you animals such as piebald ball pythons, patternless leopard geckos, Blizzard Lizards, super tigers, Albino Reticulated Pythons, Albino Tiger Reticulated Pythons, frilled dragons, etc.</p>
