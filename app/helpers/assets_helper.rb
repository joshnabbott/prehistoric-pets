module AssetsHelper
  require 'md5'

  # USAGE:
  # <%= @image = Image.first %>
  # SIMPLE:
  # <%= asset_tag(@image, :size => '400x0') %>
  # Will return an img tag with @image, sized at max 400px wide or height, depending on which is greater.
  # Possible options are:
  # +crop+ - Passes the name of a crop. Crops may have identical names across asset categories. You can specify a crop within
  # an asset category, you can pass the asset category name and crop name in this format: 'Asset Category Name::Crop Name'.
  # If you do have crops named alike across asset categories, but don't specify the asset category name, the first crop found
  # matching that name is returned.
  #
  # +size+ - In the format of either '100x0' or '100x100'. Setting both width and height will return an image resized to the widthxheight.
  # Size is a required parameter, unless +crop+ is passed (as the crop will define the +size+ and +from+ parameters.). NOTE: Passing only
  # +size+ will simply resize the image, not crop it. For a cropped version of the image at that size, pass in the +from+ option.
  #
  # +from+ - Sets the x, y values to offset the crop. Pass it in similar to the +size+ option: 100x100.
  # EXAMPLE:
  # <%= asset_tag(@image, :size => '250x250', :from => '25x25') %>
  # Will return an image cropped 25 pixels from the top left, at the exact size specified.
  #
  # +resize_to+ - The image can be resized after being cropped to specific dimenions with this option. Passed in the same format as +size+.
  # EXAMPLE:
  # <%= asset_tag(@image, :size => '250x250', :from => '25x25', :resize_to => '100x100') %>
  # Will return an image cropped at the offset specified by +from+ at the size of +size+, but then resized (not cropped) to +resize_to+
  #
  # +exact+ - This option only applies when specifying +resize_to+. Passed as true, or false. If exact is true, the image will
  # cropped to +size+, but then resized to +resize_to+ and then padded on either size, top or bottom, to make the image dimensions
  # exactly match +resize_to+.
  # EXAMPLE:
  # <%= asset_tag(@image, :size => '250x250', :from => '25x25', :resize_to => '100x100', :exact => true) %>
  # Will return an image cropped at the offset specified by +from+ at the size of +size+, resized (not cropped) to +resize_to+
  # and then padded where needed to make the exact dimensions of +resize_to+.
